# FLAGS.md — open issues carried forward

Everything here needs a human decision, a tool fix, or an in-game look. Nothing here is
resolved by translating more chunks. Items are grouped by what blocks them.

Session of 2026-08-06 delivered `tl/battle/chunk_007.txt` (7,793 / 8,192, 399 slack) and
parked `pending/chunk_005.txt` (8,679 / 8,192, 487 over).

## A. Blocking the build right now

### A1. `build` refuses to write — the patch has never been buildable

`python3 tools/assemble.py check` exits 0 and reports its two problems as warnings.
`python3 tools/assemble.py build` treats the same two as fatal and stops with
*"Refusing to write: fix the errors above first."* Consequences: `build/battle_dump_merged.txt`
is **stale** and does not contain any recently translated chunk, and
`tools/riotbattle.py checkedit` therefore cannot round-trip current work.

Prompt §0.5 assumes the patch is buildable at any moment. It is not, and has not been for as
long as these two lines have been untranslated.

### A2. Root cause — exactly two untranslated messages block everything

Neither line appears in `tl/script/batch_001.tsv`. Both fall through from the pristine
`dumps/script_dump.txt`, and the checker validates fall-through **Japanese** against the
English charset and column rules. So the build is blocked by source text nobody has touched.

| Source line | Content | Size | Why it fails |
|---|---|---|---|
| `script_dump.txt:1234` | Anselmo / Cress war council — the 9th Army recriminations, Zephyr Krippen reveal, decision to march on the great fortress | 503 JP chars, ~62 segments | one segment is 39 columns > 24 |
| `script_dump.txt:8604` | horse-race betting tutorial (脚質, past placings, form) | 388 JP chars, ~42 segments | contains `×` (U+00D7) |

**Translating these two messages makes the entire patch buildable.** That is plausibly worth
more than the next battle chunk. Note they are large — together roughly one battle chunk of work.

### A3. `×` in line 8604 is a button glyph, not punctuation

It refers to the PS1 ✗ button (`×ボタンを押してね`). The §3.1 charset has no glyph for it, so this
needs a charset or font decision, not just a translation. Options: spell it (`ｔｈｅ　✗　ｂｕｔｔｏｎ`
is unavailable; `ｔｈｅ　Ｘ　ｂｕｔｔｏｎ` costs 12 columns), or add the glyph to the font table via
`riotfont.py`. Same question will recur for ○ △ □.

## B. Blocking tier A chunks

### B1. Chunk 5 is infeasible in 8,192 bytes

Three passes: natural 1.97x → disciplined 1.74x → maximum compression short of deleting
content **1.64x**. The budget requires **1.53x**. Final: 8,679 bytes, **487 over**.
Parked in `pending/`.

### B2. 1.64x is a floor, not slack — measured, not asserted

Achieved ratios on chunks already shipped:

| chunk | budget ratio | **achieved** ratio |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1.74 | **1.73** |
| 10 | 8.39 | 1.88 |
| 12 | 8.49 | 2.10 |
| 33 | 9.52 | 1.93 |

Chunk 5 at 1.64x is **tighter than anything the project has shipped** and still misses.
The remaining sanctioned lever (§2.1 step 2, merging segments to delete `{FFFE}`) was measured
exhaustively: 29 mergeable pairs, **58 bytes**, against 487 needed. Closing the rest requires
deleting sentences, which §2.1 forbids.

### B3. Tier A is probably dead as a whole — decide before spending two more sessions

Chunk 16 (budget 1.59x) and chunk 32 (budget 1.61x) both sit **below** the measured 1.64x floor.
Chunk 43 (1.23x) is already parked. If the floor holds, all four tier-A chunks need the
`pending/slot-extension.md` work rather than more translation passes. Recommend settling the
`KOUSEI.EXE` question first and confirming the floor on one of 16 or 32, not both.

## C. Tooling defects

### C1. `assemble.py` does not implement the row check Appendix A claims

`validate_body` (lines 88–112) does charset and columns only. There is no page/row logic
anywhere in the file, so pages exceeding 4 text rows pass silently.

`tools/rowcheck.py` (added this session) mirrors `assemble.py`'s cost, column, charset and
tag-parity semantics and adds the missing row check plus per-line `{FFFE}` before→after diffing.
Usage: `python3 tools/rowcheck.py <chunk_num> <path_to_tl_file>`. It was calibrated against the
shipped byte figures for chunks 10, 11, 12 and 33 (exact match) and falsification-tested against
four planted violations: an overlong run, ASCII characters, a dropped tag, and `…`.

It is a stand-in, not clearance (§0.6) — `assemble.py check` remains the authority.

### C2. `riotbattle.py checkedit` has a bare `argv[3]` index

Running it with one argument raises `IndexError` instead of printing usage. Correct form is
`checkedit <original> <edited>`. One-line fix in `main`.

### C3. Chunk 33 dumper bug — recorded in `pending/README.md`, still open

`find_script_bounds` requires `\xfc\x51`; chunk 33 uses only `{FC50}`. Already documented; noted
here so it is not lost.

---

## D. Source defects (do not "fix" silently)

### D1. Dump artifact in chunk 5 line 17

`{FC70}{=00}逓{=20000E}` where lines 14 and 16 have the clean `{FC70}{=0062}{FC20}{=000E}`.
The dumper decoded argument bytes 0x9276 as Shift-JIS text. Preserved verbatim in the
translation. **Chunk 5 could not have passed `check` even at budget**, because this trips the
charset rule. Fix belongs in the dumper, not the translation.

### D2. Source pages exceeding 4 text rows are real

14 of them, across chunks 5, 6, 7, 30, 32, 36, 37 and 42. Worst is chunk 32 line 31 at
**59 rows**. None of the nine chunks shipped before this session contained one, which is why
this has not come up.

Chunk 5 source line 10 has a 7-row and a 5-row page. Chunk 7 line 23 has 5 rows. In both cases
source structure was preserved rather than inserting `{FCC0}`, because the text looks like
auto-advancing cutscene narration where a page break would be wrong. **Needs an in-game look
to confirm.**

### D3. Chunk 7 line 24 — the one place in shipped work that needs eyes

`{FFFE}` went 6 → 8. Both additions are forced: source segments 3 and 5 are 16 and 20 JP chars
and overflow 24 columns in any English rendering. But this pushes an already-out-of-spec page
from 6 rows to 8. Everything else in chunk 7 is within spec. Check this textbox in game before
considering chunk 7 final.

Other `{FFFE}` changes in chunk 7: lines 25 and 26, 0 → 1 each (splitting
`Ｔｈｅ　ｖｉｌｌａｇｅ　ｉｓ　ｕｎｄｅｒ　ａｔｔａｃｋ．` off the 24-column limit).

## E. Naming and translation decisions that could be revisited

All are entered in `glossary.md` §14 and cross-referenced from §13.

| Item | Decision | Why it might change |
|---|---|---|
| `キャビア` → Cavia | §14.1 | kana are exactly the loanword *caviar*; the pun may be deliberate (§13.14) |
| `ナコール` → Nacol | §14.1 | no in-game romanisation; alt *Nakor*, *Nacoll* (§13.15) |
| `ティータ` → Tita | §14.1 | **hapax** — one occurrence in the battle dump, zero in the script dump. Not a typo for ティミー: in ch.5 line 10 Fei is *surprised* by Timmy's arrival, so she was not calling her in line 1. Possibly Fei's beast, since Fei is a 獣使い, or a cut character (§13.16) |
| `ベルナール` → Bernard | §14.2 | alt *Bernal* |
| `オーク` → orc (lowercase) | §14.3 | class-table form still open (§10.2, §13.17) |

### E1. Deviations from literal (§2.1 steps 5–6)

**Chunk 7:** 敵さん、大勢で → *Look at them all* (implication for the count);
傭兵あがりの若造ども → *Mercenary upstarts* (drops the youth sense);
王女の命、いただいたぞ → *Her life is mine*;
世話んなったじいさん → *the old man who raised her*;
お父様たちも → *your father* (drops the plural);
エチュード → *etude* (no `é` in charset).

**Chunk 5:** 橋の前にもオークが drops も; 王女様だけじゃなく → *not only her*;
自分たちで守る → *guarded our own*; Cavia given `ｃａｎ’ｔ` in her exhausted opening line,
against her otherwise uncontracted register (§14.6) — the one deliberate exception.
